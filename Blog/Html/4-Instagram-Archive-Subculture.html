              <h1 class="articleTitle2">How to make money with WordPress blogging</h1>
              <br><p>Launching your website online and making money out of it are two different things. The former can be real quick, but the latter will surely take time. This section seeks to enlighten you on a couple of easy tips you can use to monetize your WordPress blog.</p>
              <br><p><b>•	Write content on your site.</b></p>
              <br><p>For a start, you need is a typing device and internet connection. According to NetCraft, an England-based internet service provider, there are over 1.5 billion websites on the World Wide Web. Guess what? All these websites need fresh content. That means content writing cuts across all niches. Some platforms not only pay their users for writing content, but also have ranking systems, and that can be a great means to market yourself.</p>
              <br><p><b>•	Affiliate Marketing</b></p>
              <br><p>There are many affiliate programs available on all niches. Once you've joined one of them, you're able to recommend their products to your site visitors by having attached liked on your websites. Every time your visitors click to buy the product, you receive a commission. Before opting into either of the programs, you should figure out what your clients may be
                interested in. Through this, you're able to track a larger audience and hence, accumulate more returns in the end.</p>
              <br><p><b>•	Using Google AdSense.</b></p>
              <br><p>This is also a marketing plan offered by Google. To get started, add to your website a Google script. The script installs ads to your website, and every time your visitors click an ad, you bag some commission. The ads are either on a Cost Per Click (CPCs) or Cost Per Impression (CPMs) plan. CPCs are paid for when a visitor clicks an ad while CPMs are paid for every review. </p>
              <br><p><b>•	Website flipping</b></p>
              <br><p>At times, companies or individuals prefer to purchase already existing websites. In such a case, you can become a website reseller. Having skills to build and deploy WordPress websites makes you way more qualified. You can build a website, get traffic and sell it later. You may consider using platforms like Flippa for ease of auctioning. </p>
              <br><p><b>•	Reviews Writing</b></p>
              <br><p>This is a very easy method to use. You just have to identify a product, use it for free and thereafter write your experience as a review. However, you should endeavor to review only those products that are related to your niche, so that your visitors can capture the attention of your visitors.</p>
              <br><p>As can be seen, there are many ways in which you can turn your WordPress blog into a real income site. </p>

            <div class="articleBody">
              <h1 class="articleTitle2">Instagram Archive Subculture</h1>

              <br><p>At some point as an Instagram marketer or just a good fan of Instagram, am pretty sure you’ve found yourself in this dilemma—where you want to delete a post you made some time back—but then you don’t want to entirely lose the content, right?
                <br><br>Well, that’s now a story of the past! Since Instagram introduced the archive functionality in June 2017, it has continued to be a great game-changer for the Instagram community.

              </p><br><h2>So, what exactly is Instagram Archive Subculture?</h2>
              <p>In simple terms, this is just an alternative to deleting your posts.
                <br><br>It lets you hide a post you don’t want your followers to see on your profile.
                Now, if you are a marketer, you can agree with me this is quite handy.
                <br><br>Think of an offer you are giving your clients for a given duration, and then after the expiry, you want to hide it from them, but still have it on your account for future reference.
                <br><br>But that’s not all.
                <br><br>If in future you decide to show it back on your profile, Instagram Archive Subculture gives you that functionality.
                <br><br><p>So, that’s where Instagram Archive Subculture comes in.</p>

              <br><h2>In a nutshell, this feature allows you to:</h2>

              <p class="indenting">
                • Hide a post and show it back on your profile anytime at your convenience
                <br>• Automatically keep your profile organized chronologically, even after reinstating a post you had archived.
                <br>• Keep your likes and comments intact within the post—they cannot be lost because the feature disables editing of posts in the archive, which is very important in case you need some information back.
                <br>• Keep your account stable because your Instagram analytics are never affected, unlike deleting the post entirely. This is very key in marketing.
                <br>• Archive your Instagram stories—they are saved in the archive chronologically, unlike posts that are saved based on whichever was archived first.
                <br>• Repost, download or delete stories from the archive.

              </p>

              <!-- <ol>
                <li>Hide a post and show it back on your profile anytime at your convenience
                </li><li>Automatically keep your profile organized chronologically, even after reinstating a post you had archived.

              </ol> -->


              <br><p>Cool features, right?
              </p><br><p>But wait, have you heard about Skid?
              </p><br><p>Sked is yet another great feature that allows you to interact with your archives quite conveniently.
                The tool allows you to schedule posts directly from your archive. Once you have scheduled your desired time for your post, it automatically updates it even when you are off!
                <br><br>So, why not try it out?

              </p><br><h2>How to use Instagram archive subculture to better your Marketing Strategy</h2>
              </p><br><p>While Instagram is very useful for documenting your life events and sharing what is happening around you with your remote friends, it can go beyond that.
                <br><br>I mean, you can earn a lot from it!
                <br><br>And actually, this has been made even much better by Instagram archive subculture.
                <br><br>So, let’s jump right in and explore some best practices to optimize your marketing schemes.

              </p><br><h3>• Hide outdated posts
              </h3></p><br><p>I am pretty sure you have those posts you made just for a specific event, or maybe you were giving out discounts within a specific duration.
                <br><br>Now that the content became irrelevant, do you still need the post?
                <br><br>Well, that's a yes and no. Yes because you need to maintain your engagement data and safeguard your followers’ complements, and no because it seems like junk on your profile, right?
                <br><br>You can neither delete the post nor do you want it on your profile.
                <br><br>So?
                <br><br>You got it—Archive! That will definitely optimize your profile with the most relevant content that is capable of driving even more sales.

              </p><br><h3>• Borrow marketing ideas from your previous posts
              </h3></p><br><p>As a marketing specialist, you can agree with me that coming up with fresh content every day or perhaps a couple of days can be hectic, right?
                <br><br>So, when you are so dry of something to post, what do you do?
                <br><br>Sure, refer to your archive.
                <br><br>The best thing with archiving is that once the post is archived, you can only view it—no editing.
                <br><br>And that is something you really want because when you don’t have content, you can always reuse the images or content you shared years ago, and it works just fine!
                <br><br>If you deleted the post instead of archiving, then chances are that you would have forgotten about it already, and there you are! Dry indeed.

              </p><br><h3>• Switch the focus of your profile comfortably
              </h3></p><br><p>Sometimes, you want to market a totally different or antagonistic product to what you have been sharing in the past.
                <br><br>And now you are there, wondering, “Will my followers really buy the product now that it is antagonistic to my profile?”
                <br><br>That is when you get the perfect opportunity to explore the full power of archiving.
                <br><br>You can simply clear (archive) your profile and customize it to perfectly fit your current product.
                <br><br>With this, no one will realize your smart marketing game.
                <br><br>And you know what? Those are pure sales!

              </p><br><h3>• Hold the post on for correction
              </h3></p><br><p>If by any chance you made a typo or posted content that you later realized was either insensitive or offensive, you will of course want to pin it down, right?
                <br><br>Deleting the post immediately can be an option, but think about the followers’ feedback and the bunch of content you will end up losing.
                <br><br>That’s not ideal, right?
                <br><br>Perhaps it is something that needed some little rewording.
                <br><br>So again, archiving the post becomes the best option.
                <br><br>If it was a minor mistake, you can safely correct and repost it. But if it truly deserved the wild response from followers, you can as well keep it safely for future reference.

              </p><br><h3>• Post a story that attracted good traffic
              </h3></p><br><p>Remember what we said about archiving Instagram stories in the beginning?
                <br><br>Now this is the perfect opportunity to leverage this feature.
                <br><br>If you made a story that attracted tons of comments, likes, views, and outstanding poll responses, it automatically implies the story was great.
                <br><br>So, why not post it on your profile?
                <br><br>Now to do this, you no longer have to take a screenshot of every story. This feature also allows you to transform the story before posting it.
                <br><br>So just archive it and thereafter share it on your profile. Simple!

              </p><br><p>-------------------------
                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
              </p><p>The features that Instagram Archive Subculture provides are just mind-blowing!
                <br><br>The great transformative features available gives you all the flexibility you need and the capacity to optimize your account for better sales if you are in marketing.
                <br><br>So, there you go! Make the best out of it.
